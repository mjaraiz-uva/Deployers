# Deployers
The program implements four types of agents: individuals, Producers (firms), Banks, and the State.
To run the simulation (1000 settlers, 120 years) rename a copy of the DeployersInput-Settlers-120years.txt 
file to DeployersInput.txt. This file should be in the same directory as Deployers.exe and DeployersInterface.g.
The simulation takes about 100 s on a 4GHz computer.
